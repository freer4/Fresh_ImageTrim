# Fresh_ImageTrim
Easy front-end image "white-space" trimming!

Attach the trim function to the load event as shown and your image gets the white removed from top, left, right, and bottom. This is pretty basic and not totally comprehensive yet. 

## To do:

- Will add color specification
- Will default to 3-part white instead of "probably white"
